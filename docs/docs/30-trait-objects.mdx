# Trait objects

[Trait objects](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html) in Rust look like a way to achieve a polymorphic behaviour without having full OOP features in the language.

I wanted to explore this direction, since I _felt_ there was something interesting to do by defining some general methods for a `Project` maybe, and then write every implementation of `Project`.

## Generics or trait objects ?

I already tried with generics but didn't really got somewhere.

The difference between generics and trait objects is mostly **static** vs **dynamic** dispatch.

## Generics - Static dispatch

With generics, you have **static** dispatch : during compile-time, Rust looks through your code, and for a given generic function, it's able to determine which _version_ of this function will be used during execution. it then uses **monomorphization** to generate the appropriate versions of this generic function (one for each type). That's why we talk about **zero-cost abstraction** when using generics in Rust.

So I imagined, maybe designing something like that could work, and be elegant as well :

```rust
pub struct Project<T> {
  pub path: PathBuf,
  pub project_type: Vec<ProjectType>,
}
```

And then, be able to create, as I wanted, `Project<Composer>` or `Project<Npm>`, maybe. But the compiler told me I had to use the generic type inside the struct...I finally found that I could "fake" the use of the generic type by using a `PhantomData` into the struct, kind of a marker indicating how to infer the type when used.

But it didn't smell good. I'm learning, and if I start using things to "fake" data, I don't like it. I'd rather try another method.

So, let's try the trait objects.

## Trait objects - Dynamic dispatch

With trait objects, we really have the same idea as polymorphism in OOP : you define a trait, and then specify that a parameter or a return type must be like `dyn MyTrait`, or even `Box<dyn MyTrait>`. The difference is that the compiler won't generate a specific version of the function for each concrete type implementing the trait. Instead, it will look at runtime which method it has to execute. From the documentation :

> A trait object points to both an instance of a type implementing our specified trait and a table used to look up trait methods on that type at runtime

:::info The Box Smart-pointer

The [`Box`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-01-box.html) smart-pointer allows us to point to data on the heap rather than the stack.

One of the scenario where we can use it, from the documentation, is "When you want to own a value and **you care only that itâ€™s a type that implements a particular trait** rather than being of a specific type".

So what if our `Project` just became a contract, a trait ?

```rust
pub trait Project: erased_serde::Serialize {
    fn get_folders() -> Vec<ProjectDir>
    where
        Self: Sized;
    fn get_variants() -> Option<Vec<ProjectVariant>>
    where
        Self: Sized;
    fn get_infos(&self) -> &ProjectInfos;
}
```

Here, to make a simple trait, I defined three methods : one to get the folders (build, dependencies, cache, etc...different types), another to get the variants of a project (let's say we have a Composer project, maybe one variant would be Symfony, another Laravel, etc...same for NPM with NextJS, GatsbyJS, Remix, React, Angular, and all of the billions libs/frameworks out there), and a last one to get the project's infos (the path, and maybe type).

About the infos, I couldn't think of another way to do that because we can't define properties in traits...so I kind of had to define this "getter" to the project's info and then use composition to have informations in every `struct`. Not bad, but not very good.

Finally, the `erased_serde::Serialize` thing was here just to make anything implementing this trait serializable (at least I think), and the `where` clauses are here because of [**object safety**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety) : basically, non-methods (without `self` in parameters) cannot be dispatched.

That's already a lot, and I start to feel it's not that good.

Then, I defined two modules : `composer` and `npm`, each defining their own `struct` and providing an implementation of `Project`. Here is an example with the `composer` module :

```rust
use crate::project::ProjectDirType;

use super::{Project, ProjectDir, ProjectInfos, ProjectVariant};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, serde::Serialize)]
pub struct Composer {
    pub infos: ProjectInfos,
}

impl Project for Composer {
    fn get_folders() -> Vec<ProjectDir> {
        vec![ProjectDir {
            name: String::from("vendor"),
            dir_type: ProjectDirType::Dependencies,
        }]
    }

    fn get_infos(&self) -> &ProjectInfos {
        &self.infos
    }

    fn get_variants() -> Option<Vec<ProjectVariant>> {
        Some(vec![ProjectVariant {
            name: String::from("Symfony"),
            dirs: vec![ProjectDir {
                name: String::from("var/cache"),
                dir_type: ProjectDirType::Cache,
            }],
        }])
    }
}
```

Finally, I was able to make all of this work, but it resulted in much more code than I imagined. Even though the file separation looked better (at least for me), I wasn't satisfied : it's definitely too heavy for what I need.

So, let's go back to something more simple. Maybe at this point I'm starting to understand why Kondo did this way. At least I learned some new knowledge about the language during this research, so it's fine.
