# Introduction

This little Tauri app aims to help developers cleaning projects dependencies and cache/build files to free some space on the disk. For me, I do it to get a better knowledge of the Rust language.

There is already the very good [Kondo tool](https://github.com/tbillington/kondo), written in Rust, from which I'll get some inspiration.

That's why there will be some Kondo source code analysis, as well.

## Stack

Since I want to improve on the Rust language, I decided to use Tauri and make the UI with a React app.

React project is set up using Vite/Typescript. I didn't see a reason to pull a whole NextJS project for that, so I decided to stick on a traditional React app.
